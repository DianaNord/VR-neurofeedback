abstract = {Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a childhood syndrome characterized by short attention span, impulsiveness and hyperactivity, which often leads to learning disabilities and various behavioral problems. For the treatment of ADHD, medication and cognitive-behavior therapy has been applied in recent years. Although psychostimulant medication has been widely used for many years, current findings suggest that, as the sole treatment for ADHD, it is an inadequate form of intervention, in that parents don't want their child to use drugs and the effects are limited to the period in which the drugs are physiologically active. On the other hand, EEG biofeedback treatment studies for ADHD have reported promising results not only in significant reductions in hyperactive, inattentive and disruptive behaviors, but also in improvements in academic performance and IQ scores. However, it is too boring for children to finish the whole treatment. The recent increase in computer usage in medicine and rehabilitation has changed the way health care is delivered. Virtual reality (VR) technology provides specific stimuli that can be used in removing distractions and in providing environments that get the subjects' attention and increase their ability to concentrate, and VR technology can hold a patient's attention for a longer period of time than other methods, because VR is immersive, interactive and imaginary. Based on these aspects, we developed the Attention Enhancement System (AES) using VR technology and EEG biofeedback for assessing and treating ADHD children as well as increasing the attention span of children who have attention difficulties.},

abstract = {•Embodied VR training for MI-BCI was developed and compared to the standard Graz protocol.•Neurofeedback in our training environment was represented by the avatar movements in VR.•Performance was measured using online BCI evaluation.•Participants trained using the VR environment gained higher average accuracy (58.3%) in BCI control than the control group (52.9%).
[Display omitted]
Motor imagery (MI) is the predominant control paradigm for brain–computer interfaces (BCIs). After sufficient effort is invested to the training, the accuracy of commands mediated by mental imagery of bodily movements grows to a satisfactory level. However, many issues with the MI-BCIs persist; e.g., low bit transfer rate, BCI illiteracy, sub-optimal training procedure. Especially the training process for the MI-BCIs requires improvements. Currently, the training has an inappropriate form, resulting in a high mental and temporal demand on the users (weeks of training are required for the control). This study aims at addressing the issues with the MI-BCI training. To support the learning process, an embodied training environment was created. Participants were placed into a virtual reality environment observed from a first-person view of a human-like avatar, and their rehearsal of MI actions was reflected by the corresponding movements performed by the avatar. Leveraging extension of the sense of ownership, agency, and self-location towards a non-body object (principles known from the rubber hand illusion and the body transfer illusions) has already been proven to help in producing stronger EEG correlates of MI. These principles were used to facilitate the MI-BCI training process for the first time. Performance of 30 healthy participants after two sessions of training was measured using an on-line BCI scenario. The group trained using our embodied VR environment gained significantly higher average accuracy for BCI actions (58.3%) than the control group, trained with a standard MI-BCI training protocol (52.9%).},

abstract = {The ability to control electroencephalographic (EEG) signals when different mental tasks are carried out would provide a method of communication for people with serious motor function problems. This system is known as a brain–computer interface (BCI). Due to the difficulty of controlling one's own EEG signals, a suitable training protocol is required to motivate subjects, as it is necessary to provide some type of visual feedback allowing subjects to see their progress. Conventional systems of feedback are based on simple visual presentations, such as a horizontal bar extension. However, virtual reality is a powerful tool with graphical possibilities to improve BCI-feedback presentation. The objective of the study is to explore the advantages of the use of feedback based on virtual reality techniques compared to conventional systems of feedback. Sixteen untrained subjects, divided into two groups, participated in the experiment. A group of subjects was trained using a BCI system, which uses conventional feedback (bar extension), and another group was trained using a BCI system, which submits subjects to a more familiar environment, such as controlling a car to avoid obstacles. The obtained results suggest that EEG behaviour can be modified via feedback presentation. Significant differences in classification error rates between both interfaces were obtained during the feedback period, confirming that an interface based on virtual reality techniques can improve the feedback control, specifically for untrained subjects.},

ABSTRACT={Rehabilitation for stroke patients with severe motor impairments (e.g., inability to perform wrist or finger extension on the affected side) is burdensome and difficult because most current rehabilitation options require some volitional movement to retrain the affected side. However, although these patients participate in therapy requiring volitional movement, previous research has shown that they may receive modest benefits from action observation, virtual reality (VR), and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). These approaches have shown some success in strengthening key motor pathways thought to support motor recovery after stroke, in the absence of volitional movement. The purpose of this study was to combine the principles of VR and BCI in a platform called REINVENT and assess its effects on four chronic stroke patients across different levels of motor impairment. REINVENT acquires post-stroke EEG signals that indicate an attempt to move and drives the movement of a virtual avatar arm, allowing patient-driven action observation neurofeedback in VR. In addition, synchronous electromyography (EMG) data were also captured to monitor overt muscle activity. Here we tested four chronic stroke survivors and show that this EEG-based BCI can be safely used over repeated sessions by stroke survivors across a wide range of motor disabilities. Finally, individual results suggest that patients with more severe motor impairments may benefit the most from EEG-based neurofeedback, while patients with more mild impairments may benefit more from EMG-based feedback, harnessing existing sensorimotor pathways. We note that although this work is promising, due to the small sample size, these results are preliminary. Future research is needed to confirm these findings in a larger and more diverse population.}
