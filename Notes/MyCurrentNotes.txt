## Start the ssh-agent in the background
eval `ssh-agent -s`

## Experiment Protocol
EEG Sports MI:
	Each type of MI 15 times per run, 4 runs
	fixation-cross (4s) - MI/ME (6s) - rest (4s)
Effects BCI VR Feedback:
	Baseline (10s) - MI/ME (20s) - rest (4min)
Change in Performance using VR:
	fixation-cross (2s) - MI/ME (8s - 2.25s cue, 5.75s feedback) - rest (random 0.5-3s)
Rapid Prototyping (Graz BCI Protocol):
	4 runs of 40 trials
	fixation-cross (2s) - beep - cue (3-4.25s) - continuous feedback (4.25-8s) - rest (random 0.5-2.5s)
	session 1: without FB -> set up subject-specific weight vector
	session 2 & 3: weight vector was used for presenting FB
	session 4: without FB -> new weight vector established
	session 5 & 6: feedback with new weight vector
